Notes:
    A few files were taken from the sample code for this assignment, and
    untouched by me. These are noted above in this README file. Several other
    files were also copied from the sample code provided that contain
    modifications and additions to existing and new functions. All changes 
    and additions were made by me.
    
    I wrote my code using a combination of BBEdit on the Mac, and server-side
    editing using Emacs. Indentation is 4-space wide tabs. Before submission,
    I ran the Emacs command 'M-x untabify' to convert tabs to spaces.
